## Preface
AngraMainyu — the destructive spirit that challenges the existing order.  
We transform this name into the creative energy of Zarathu,  
establishing new order and beauty beyond mere destruction.

We are all **Artists working for the benefit of all humanity**.  
Expressing our individuality, we create beauty and make the world a more beautiful place.

### Logo
<img src="img/Zarathu_Pattern.webp" width="300">

Our logo is inspired by **single-pattern asymmetric tiling**.  
The repeated pattern never forms perfect symmetry, perfectly expressing Zarathu's philosophy.

- **Single Pattern**: We are all human and dream of benefiting all humanity.  
- **Asymmetry**: Each expresses their own individuality.  
- **Endless Creation**: Similar humans express different individualities, filling the world completely and endlessly creating.

Zarathu brings together artists with unique individuality to continuously create a beautiful world.

## Scripture
The scripture of this repository is Nietzsche's **Thus Spoke Zarathustra**.  
Zarathu community’s philosophy is based on the teachings of this book,  
institutionalized and preserved through ritual milestones and record-keeping.
