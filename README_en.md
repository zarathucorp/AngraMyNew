## 🜂 **Name Origin**
> **AngraMyNew = Angra Mainyu + My + New**  
> From the god of destruction, to my new world.  

“Angra Mainyu” — the ancient Persian spirit of chaos —  
is reborn here as the spark of **creative destruction**.  
We do not worship; we **create**.  
Each of us carries the fire of AngraMyNew within.  

> **AngraMyNew = The world reborn through me.**

---

## 🜃 **1. Our Origin**
AngraMyNew begins with destruction, but its goal is creation.  
We break old beliefs to build a **new order of beauty**.  
We are not destroyers, but **recomposers**.  

---

## 🜄 **2. Our Spirit**
- Like **Nietzsche’s Übermensch**, we transcend human limits.  
- Like **Deleuze’s Becoming**, we reject fixed identities.  
- Like **Heidegger’s thought of Being**, we question essence.  
- Like **Zhuangzi and Laozi’s Wu Wei**, we create without force.  
- Like **Ken Wilber’s Integral Consciousness**, we unite the divided.

## 🜅 **3. Our Belief**
> “Every human is an artist,  
>  and art itself is a new ethic and civilization.”  

Each individuality forms a part of the whole,  
and diversity becomes an **asymmetric beauty without end**.

## 🜆 **4. Our Symbol**
<p align="center">
  <img src="img/Zarathu_Pattern.webp" width="300" alt="AngraMyNew Pattern Logo">
</p>

Inspired by **asymmetric tiling**,  
our logo represents endless creation through imperfection.  

- **One pattern**: Humanity’s shared essence  
- **Asymmetry**: Expression of individuality  
- **Endless creation**: Harmony through diversity
