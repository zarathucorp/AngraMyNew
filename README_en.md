# AngraMyNew

> **"Through beauty, we create a new world."**

---

## Name Origin

> **AngraMyNew = Angra Mainyu + My + New**
> From the god of destruction, to my new world.

"Angra Mainyu" — the ancient Persian spirit of chaos —
is reborn here as the spark of **creative destruction**.
We do not worship; we **create**.
Each of us carries the fire of AngraMyNew within.

---

## 1. Our Origin

AngraMyNew begins with destruction, but its goal is creation.
We break old beliefs to build a **new order of beauty**.
We are not destroyers, but **recomposers**.

---

## 2. Our Spirit

Like **Nietzsche**, we become the Übermensch who creates our own values.

Like **The Five Pioneers**, we die at our chosen place:
- **Kim Ok-kyun** — Revolutionary ahead of his time, assassinated in Shanghai
- **Ma Kwang-soo** — Artist who shattered taboos, cried "Is this not beautiful?" until the end
- **Heo Gyun** — Rebel who wrote Hong Gildong, executed by dismemberment
- **Sung Jae-ki** — Warrior who never bent his conviction, perished at the Han River
- **John Law** — Financial genius 200 years ahead, died in poverty in Venice

Like **Mengchangjun**, we embrace even those who seem useless.

> "Life is a journey to find the place where you will die."

---

## 3. Our Belief

> "Every human is an artist,
>  and art itself is a new ethic and civilization."

Each individuality forms a part of the whole,
and diversity becomes an **asymmetric beauty without end**.

---

## 4. Our Symbol

<p align="center">
  <img src="img/Zarathu_Pattern.webp" width="300" alt="AngraMyNew Pattern Logo">
</p>

Our logo is inspired by the **Einstein Tile**.

In 2023, amateur mathematician David Smith solved a 60-year-old puzzle:
**"Can a single shape tile an infinite plane without repeating patterns?"**

The 13-sided tile he discovered is called "Einstein" (ein + stein, "one stone" in German).

- **One shape**: The universal essence of humanity
- **No repeating patterns**: No two humans are the same
- **Infinite expansion**: Creation never ends

> *"What was deemed impossible for 60 years, an amateur proved possible."*
